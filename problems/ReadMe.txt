Certainly! Here are some simple problems that involve using boolean values and comparison operators in programming:

1)Even or Odd Number Checker:
Write a program that takes an integer as input and determines whether it's even or odd. Then, print "Even" or "Odd" accordingly.

2)Age Verification:
Create a program that asks for the user's age. If the age is 18 or older, print "You are an adult." Otherwise, print "You are not an adult yet."

3)Password Checker:
Implement a password checker that asks the user to enter a password. If the password matches a predefined correct password, print "Access granted." Otherwise, print "Access denied."

4)Grade Calculator:
Write a program that takes a numeric grade (0-100) as input and converts it to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on the following criteria:

A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: 0-59

5)Leap Year Checker:
Create a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, except if it's also divisible by 400.

6)Logical Operations:
Given two boolean values, A and B, perform the following logical operations and print the results:

A AND B
A OR B
NOT A

7)Temperature Converter:
Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user should input a temperature and specify whether it's in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Then, convert it to the other scale and print the result.

8) Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and calculates their:
-sum.  -average.    -Reverse.
